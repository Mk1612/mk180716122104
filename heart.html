            <h1>Please Hear Me Out</h1>
            <p>I know words can't undo the hurt I’ve caused, but I need to explain everything because you deserve that.</p>
            <p>The day of your surgery, I should’ve been there. I know that now, and I’ve thought about it over and over. I didn’t go because your mother was there, and I wasn’t sure if it was okay for me to show up. When Alizah said I should, I hesitated ke aunty is there she said she didn't wanted to meet me jab tuk ghar pe na bataoon and ghar pe i was the fucking drive i went few days uni in those days but yaar i swear to Allah i regret i should have come i should have, that hesitation was a mistake. I should have been by your side, no questions asked. I regret it deeply.</p>
            <p>After that, everything just spiraled. I thought telling my mother about us would help us get over this and would help us alot, but it did the opposite. Things got heavy, and I couldn’t handle the pressure. I couldn’t think straight. I shut down and started fighting with my mom constantly. You saw it. I wasn’t myself. When I went to my friend’s house, it wasn’t because I was choosing them over you. I just wanted to escape the mess at home – the arguments with my mom, the tension with my dad and that feeling staying all day around the house. But in trying to run from it all, I didn’t realize I ran from you. And that’s where I really messed up. This fuck up is gonna haunt me till the day comes you forgive me , i have to make amends for this and i will Mahnoor i will and for our future when you become my wife Insha'Allah I can make up even more for all this even if I don't have to, I will I will.</p>
            <p>I didn’t realize I was pushing you away until you started distancing yourself. You said “I love you” less, the long messages became shorter, and it hit me – I was losing you. That’s why I’ve been hating myself. I hate the way I handled everything, how I hurt you without even realizing it in the moment.</p>
            <p>When I promised to make it better, things blew up again with my mom, i couldn't handle the situation that day and that’s why I couldn’t come when you were waiting. I can’t even explain how sorry I am for letting you down again. It eats me up inside every day. I’ve cried, I’ve prayed, and I’ve made a promise to myself, to Allah, and to you that I’m going to be better, I'll never make you feel like this, i'll take a stand for you i'll fight for you and i know how much i owe you i know i just need a chance to only makeup for all this but show you this side of me which you will adore and which you'll love more i swear you will i swear.</p>
            <p>I don’t want to lose us. I don’t want to be the person who hurts you anymore. I swear to you, I’m changing. I’m working on it because I hate what I did. Please, forgive me. I know it’ll take time to rebuild what I’ve broken, but I’m ready to do whatever it takes to be the partner you deserve – the partner I promised to be. I love you so much, and I swear, I will never stop trying to make this right. This last chance it will be a new and a better beginning i swear.</p>
