        <h1>Dear Mahnoor,</h1>
        <p>
            For the better part of the last four years, I have loved you, and I have never stopped caring for you. Since that night in Credo, where I first made you smile, to today, you have filled my heart. I cannot imagine spending my life without you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our nikkah, marrying you, our honeymoon, and all our plans... We can’t leave our story untold and unlived. There’s so much more to discuss; I cannot now imagine spending my life without you, our nikkah, marrying you, honeymoon, and our sus plans. That list of ours , and we have so much more to discuss; Where we wanna settle, how we wanna marry, kesay logon ko shadi main katana apni xD, that list needs some additions, those honeymoon plans need some more adjustments. 😉
        </p>
        <h2>KIDS, MAHNOOR! KIDS!</h2>
        <p>
            I want to have kids with you, and I still remember your fav name Anaya ! The fun we’ll have together is something we can’t lose.
        </p>
        <p>
            We share a special energy. Mahnoor, we have the same literal energy in our SUSNESS, and we can’t lose that. We both are needy for each other in so manyy ways emotional,physical,so so many things, and we should be for each other for the rest of our lives yk what we had was beautiful and its not lost it just needs to be rekindled now. The hugs are calming, and the kisses are breathtaking. I swear, I’m never kissing anyone else; it’s only you.
        </p>
        <h2>Imagine ten years from now.</h2>
        <p>
            We’ll look back and think, “Damn, we’ve been together since 2021, and we’ve only kissed one person.” That person will always be each other. Well, things would get messier, of course.
        </p>
        <p>
            2021 to Forever is the goal, Mahnoor. I would take a bullet for you. You are my purpose, and my life revolves around you. My growth, mental stability, maturity—everything is because of you. I’m scared of losing you because this love is only for you, and it continues to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
            No matter how late you reply, it’s you I want to talk to. You are supposed to be my partner and best friend. We should be one unit, sharing everything. Let’s make that happen, Mahnoor.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to love one woman for the rest of my life, and that woman is you. When you love someone, you don’t stop ever, even if people call you crazy. I NEVER WANT TO GIVE UP ON YOU.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember we are business partners tooooo??? Husband and Wife duo opening a cafe downtown somewhere in Canada or Uk or Australia. I wanna grow with you i wanna plan with you, I wanna do so so much with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            You’re the last girl I will love, trust, and hold. 2021 to Forever is our goal. One person we've held, kissed, loved, and cared for since 2021.
        </p>
        <h2>Mahnoor Kanwal, do you take me as yours?</h2>
        <p>
            As your boyfriend, your partner, your lover, your everything? Let’s rebuild everything and have a fresh start. Let me make you proud, and I will be proud of you and I am. Would you take me to call you names like baby, babe, meri jaan, Mrs. Khurram, to say good morning first thing in the morning and get upset if the other didn't, say goodnight I love you and love you more, to tell each other about our days, to call, to have dates, to cry together, smile together, motivate each other, handle each other, be with each other? All I am trying to say is let’s just fix this. I can never ever lose you, and what I am trying to ask you is...
        </p>
        <h2>MK, will you be mine again, and this time forever?</h2>
