        <h1>Dear Mahnoor,</h1>
        <p>
            For the better part of the last four years, I have loved you, and I have never stopped caring for you. Since that night in Credo, where I first made you smile, to today, you have filled my heart. I cannot imagine spending my life without you.
        </p>
        <p>I'm never gonna lose feelings for you.I'm never finding someone ever in my life,because there is no one better than you.I am never gonna cheat on you you know that, it's loyalty to you since 2021 to death.And i want you and only you,waking up beside you, travelling cuddling,laughung smiling crying everything with you.No one else.Because to me You're just perfect. Im gonna hold on to you.Nobody looks better to me than you I don't care how anybody looks because you're more Beautiful and attractive than anyone exists, babe you're the dream my dream come true i swear.</p>
        <p>
            Our nikkah, marrying you, our honeymoon, and all our plans... We can‚Äôt leave our story untold and unlived. There‚Äôs so much more to discuss; I cannot now imagine spending my life without you, our nikkah, marrying you, honeymoon, and our sus plans. That list of ours , and we have so much more to discuss; Where we wanna settle, how we wanna marry, kesay logon ko shadi main katana apni xD, that list needs some additions, those honeymoon plans need some more adjustments. üòâ
        </p>
        <h2>KIDS, MAHNOOR! KIDS!</h2>
        <p>
            I want to have kids with you, and I still remember your fav name Anaya ! The fun we‚Äôll have together is something we can‚Äôt lose.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            We share a special energy. Mahnoor, we have the same literal energy in our SUSNESS, and we can‚Äôt lose that. We both are needy for each other in so manyy ways emotional,physical,so so many things, and we should be for each other for the rest of our lives yk what we had was beautiful and its not lost it just needs to be rekindled now. The hugs are calming, and the kisses are breathtaking. I swear, I‚Äôm never kissing anyone else; it‚Äôs only you.
        </p>
        <h2>Imagine ten years from now.</h2>
        <p>
            We‚Äôll look back and think, ‚ÄúDamn, we‚Äôve been together since 2021, and we‚Äôve only kissed one person.‚Äù That person will always be each other. Well, things would get messier, of course.
        </p>
        <p>
            2021 to Forever is the goal, Mahnoor. I would take a bullet for you. You are my purpose, and my life revolves around you. My growth, mental stability, maturity‚Äîeverything is because of you. I‚Äôm scared of losing you because this love is only for you, and it continues to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
            No matter how late you reply, it‚Äôs you I want to talk to. You are supposed to be my partner and best friend. We should be one unit, sharing everything. Let‚Äôs make that happen, Mahnoor.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to love one woman for the rest of my life, and that woman is you. When you love someone, you don‚Äôt stop ever, even if people call you crazy. I NEVER WANT TO GIVE UP ON YOU.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember we are business partners tooooo??? Husband and Wife duo opening a cafe downtown somewhere in Canada or Uk or Australia. I wanna grow with you i wanna plan with you, I wanna do so so much with you.
        </p>
            <p>I love you, I‚Äôm glad I love you, you are in my heart you‚Äôll be there forever no matter if I am not in yours, I cannot imagine a life a future without loving you, I want nothing in life then to be with you, change myself for you become who you want to be with, make amends and become better because you deserve better. I swore I would never get involved with another woman because you‚Äôre above them better than them prettier adorable then them, you are worth it, worth changing for worth fighting for worth giving my life for, my wish is to make you happy and when you think of me you get happy and smile like me when I think of you. I‚Äôve matured for you now I want to mature with you again. I love you, come back home please and let me make it up for everything and let me fix you up like I did in those 3 years, I‚Äôll do that again and this time patch you up forever so we could see the northern lights in Norway you in my arms laying down on the ground.
Say yes please I miss you, this being stuck with the thought you want me or not, will you want to give a chance or not, will you want to fix this ab or not is killing me because i have so much for you and you're literally everything i feel, I don't wanna be stuck in this anxious paradox, though it has brought positive changes in me but ab mushkil horahi boss, i just want slowly built this brick by brick better than ever i swear, Har din i just pray ya Allah today is the day she answers and ya Allah it is a yes. I miss you i wanna marry you and
                
I love you alot 
</p>
        <p>
            You‚Äôre the last girl I will love, trust, and hold. 2021 to Forever is our goal. One person we've held, kissed, loved, and cared for since 2021.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Mahnoor Kanwal, do you take me as yours?</h2>
        <p>
            As your boyfriend, your partner, your lover, your everything? Let‚Äôs rebuild everything and have a fresh start. Let me make you proud, and I will be proud of you and I am. Would you take me to call you names like baby, babe, meri jaan, Mrs. Khurram, to say good morning first thing in the morning and get upset if the other didn't, say goodnight I love you and love you more, to tell each other about our days, to call, to have dates, to cry together, smile together, motivate each other, handle each other, be with each other? All I am trying to say is let‚Äôs just fix this. I can never ever lose you, and what I am trying to ask you is...
        </p>
        <p>
            Lets please fix this Mahnoor, All we need is one very long talk we'll fix this trust me we will, Just message me lets talk and lets end this distance once and for all and one last time fix this and live the life we planned.
