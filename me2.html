        <h1>Me, again</h1>
      <p>
        Mahnoor, i am a failure and i am so sorry for that. The things i said during our arguments and fights i regret that and i hate myself for it. I feel as If I'm nothing. I wake up every morning to feel the same as the day before. I'm drained, I'm lost, I'm struggling with life. I feel easily replaced and that I'm not worth to be with that's why ig you said meri jaan chordo i cried all night when you said that and i cried because I'm a burden which you want to remove from your life and i just want to prove to you I'm not a burden and i can make amends i can fix your heart everyday i pray today is the day Mahnoor answers my proposal Khurram what's the final thing? . I feel as If I will never be your first choice because I'm a fuckup no matter how much I've changed you're right it doesn't matter because the past does define me here bhalay whatever the saying is my past my fuckups will always define me by that infront of you i hate myself i hate myself so much for it. I feel as If everything I love I just lose It. Whether its a person or an object. Sometimes I wonder if I'm really that bad. I'm never happy ab, I always fake it and ab i couldn't even fake it. Last i was happy was that night we did question and answers and we talked all night about our future. I'm always annoying people, disappointing people, making mistakes, I feel like there's something wrong with me. Im trying my hardest but i feel like you don't ever wanna see it ab and just don't wanna give me a chance to prove it and i just cry thinking that I'm never gonna get that chance and im never gonna make you proud. I have no one because i never let anyone in nor i can because for me it's just you. I feel like such a failure.
        The reason why I can't ever let you go. It's because I fell in love with you not just at your best, but also at a time when you needed to feel wanted.And ever since then all i've wanted is my Red. 2 months to your birthday and I've already started finding you the best gifts because you're the only person i have ever gifted well you and Hurrum you 2 cuties and bs i pray everyday ke i'd give this gift as a last ever gift as bf and gf, and next year i'd wife you up but for that process to start you'd have to first take me back right and everyday i pray to and cry God today is that day yk.
         I know when you think of me you think of all the times i've caused you pain, and that's why i am scared that you won't ever want me back because you said to me once main nai bhoolti cheezein that is why whenever there was a fuck up i never let you take a break or space ke i'll help her get over this and i did too, Let me do this one last last, i know you want to think and the more you think alone it won't help it and i swear thats what i want to do, help you get over this help you in taking all this out of your mind and this is the first thing i'll start doing once you let me in just trust me please one last time all i want is just a little trust that's all, let me be the guy you want me to be, let me make you get over everything and let me make you fall for me all over again,please.
        When i think of our initial times and before you said I love you you talked about your whole life with me yk let me in on every single thing and that's when i fell in love with you all over again and with an unreal intensity of love because i know i'll carry a special place now because you've made me a permanent part of your life and i still remember you said if yeh sunkay you wanna leave I'll understand and i was like NEVER EVER WILL I LEAVE BECAUSE OF THIS I WANTED TO BE MAD AT YOU FOR SAYING THAT KE YOU WANNA LEAVE I'LL UNDERSTAND . I just knew that I loved you and this person im gonna make her mine marry her, and that this my first love gonna be my last.This was the day i made you my world. I don't wanna do life without you anymore, i want to be with you now and forever and show you i can be loved i am the person you do still love.
       
        Then during our 3 years from physical touches to emotional touches to our dates watching movies at nueplex our lengthy car rides our side hugs our holding hands me being all goofy and making you like KIS BACHAY KO APNA BANALIA to future planning to fighting at my home for you. To just spending nights talking with you i knew she's the one and i fucked up alot and now i have nothing because you're my everything. October to December i wanted to show you I'm still worth it I'm the guy you loved and I'm the guy you wanted to marry have kids move abroad go to Bora bora, Maldives yk. October has just been me trying and you wanting me out of your life, but there's still few days left please give me a yes so i can shower you with all the love i have for you and change you mind,heart, and fix you fix us. My mother noticed me crying and asked Khurram kyun pareshan ho and i can't explain it to her she asks me alot but no one can understand this pain of losing the loml. I love you with all my heart and soul and I'm all for changing for the best and it's an us promise to you, to me and Allah that I'll fix everything and my world trembling down broken I'll fix this, i still have you as Red on snap because you are and forever will be my Red.I miss you, I'm afraid because i want to marry you, and I need you alot, and bs I love you, I love you so fucking much.I've seen people get back together and try again to do everything right and they've been better than ever, This could be us and I'm always praying i swear ke this would be us because deep inside ik it can be it will be just trust me one final time. It's okay to start over and love each other again and this time the right fucking way, so just please let me, MK is for life so please let me make it all right.
