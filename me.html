        <div class="heart">
            <p>Mahnoor, I don’t know how else to put this into words, but these past two months without you have been the hardest of my life. I’ve felt stuck, like I’ve lost all purpose and all motivation. I have so much love in me, but none of it means anything because I don’t have you to give it to. I’ve spent countless nights crying and praying, sitting alone in my room, thinking about all the ways I’ve messed up. It’s changed me. I’ve matured because I’ve spent so much time hating myself for hurting you.</p>

            <p>Since September, all I’ve been doing is trying to figure out us. And when I say "us," I’m not talking about just getting through until July 2024. I’m talking about us, until death, because I see my entire life with you. I’ve been working on myself so much because I’m terrified of losing you forever. The thought of never being able to hold you, talk to you, or make you smile again—that kills me inside. And if I lose you, I won’t ever be able to forgive myself. I have all this love and affection, but without you, it feels empty.</p>

            <p>I’ve cried myself to sleep more times than I can count. I’ve cried in my prayers, begging for another chance—just one more chance—so we can make this right. I know the next few months are critical for us, and I need you by my side. My sister’s coming between December and March, and I see this as a window, a chance to take things to the next step before all of that happens. I have to make things right with you first, to show you that you can trust me again, to make you fall in love with me again—though I know a part of you still does. I just want to be yours again, fully and completely.</p>

            <p>I’ve started going to the gym because I promised you that before our nikkah, I’d get into the shape you always wanted me to be in. I’ve started therapy too, to stay mentally strong, to be the best version of myself for you. I’ll keep going, I’ll keep working on myself, and when you take me back, I’ll be the partner you deserve. I want to make you happy again, to take away that anxiousness and heaviness you’ve been carrying. And in doing that, I’ll take away the heaviness from my own heart.</p>
            <p>These past 2 months have been a struggle for me at home,There were things that happened these few months too that idk shouldn't have happened and when we open up about these few months one day sit and have a long chat i will talk to you tell you everything, hear your everything, but just everything was difficult and idk idk im just sorry, i'll talk about it someday tell you everything, you said main isliye itna kar raha because i feel alone, in reality, i feel alone yes but because i have been through stuff and no one to come to and tell me its okay its gonna be alright, no one to distract me, no one to make me smile and i didn't and cannot let anyone be that one because it has been and will be always you. Your importance in my life is unmatched istg. In a way it's good you didn't see me struggling like that because that could have taken a toll on you too but i would have loved if my only person would have been there. This and crying and praying and working on me is how i spent my past 2 months and wishing you were here and i understand you hate me for alot of things but i need you Mahnoor, for forever and i just wanna be yours and just give you all my love affection and everything just comeback i miss my home i need my home you are my fucking home istg.</p>
            <p>Mahnoor, I am not the same person I was before. I’ve grown, I’ve learned, and I’ve become better. All I need is a chance to prove that to you. For the love we share, for the love you still have for me, please give us another chance. I can’t lose you, yaar, I love you too much. When you take me back, I swear we’ll figure everything out, and we’ll end this year happier than we ever imagined. I promise you that.</p>
            <p>I miss you sm Maha, Please come back to me asap, please just msg what i am waiting for, i have so much i swear</p>
