        Hi Mahnoor, Ahh I know this would be a lot but trust me it's gonna show you alot and i hope good comes out of this. I loved you since I was 20 and I'm going to be 24 now. There's no soul I have ever loved in my life more than you, but I did mess up a lot. I genuinely never meant to hurt you, but it doesn't matter because I did hurt you, and I have to live with that. I have to beat myself over that my whole life because I know what you are to me, and I know I just want you for me forever and treat you best. This time it's going to be different because now I understand the cost of overreacting, overthinking, and not being myself. I want to take care of you because you understand me, and you care about me. If there's one person who can deal with my overthinking, it's you. The one who can take care of me, Mahnoor, is you.This one is for you Maha.
      </p>
